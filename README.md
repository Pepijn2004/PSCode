PSCode is my own version of a QR-code.

The size of the image is 21x21, thats pretty small. It can therefore only contain up to 40 characters.
It stores the characters as their ASCII index and is displayed as an 8b binary block: A => ASCIIdec: 64 => 01000001
I'm currently working on a PSCode-reader and might make an android app with it using nodeJS.
This is still in early development and will be updated very soon!
